# ECE and DER with x seconds of annotated training data

In the paper we show only a few points to make the small figures readable : 30, 300 and 1200 seconds. We present here the figures with all runs. Each point is the average of 3 runs.

The figure is interactive so that you can zoom in and look at the detail of each point of data.
